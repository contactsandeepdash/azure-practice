+ 1. Introduction
++ Machine learning is in many ways the intersection of two disciplines - data science and software engineering. \nThe goal of machine learning is to use data to create a predictive model that can be incorporated \ninto a software application or service. \nTo achieve this goal requires collaboration between data scientists who explore and prepare the data \nbefore using it to train a machine learning model, and software developers who integrate the models into \napplications where they're used to predict new data values (a process known as inferencing).
